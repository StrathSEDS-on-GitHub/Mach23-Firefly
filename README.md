# Firefly
Archival repository for the Firefly Project. Casually referred to as Universal Mainboard within StrathSEDS. It is the spirit successor of SHAMANBoard.

Firefly is modular flight computer aimed at model rockets. Its most important features are:
 - STM32F412 MCU
 - GNSS navigation
 - 2 double protected pyro channels
 - 9DoF IMU
 - BMP581 based pressure altimeter
 - UART, SPI, I2C and GPIO expansion headers
 - NeoPixel compatible RGB LEDs
 - W25Q flash and SDCard support for logging
 - LLCC68 based LoRa radio
 - USB-C ðŸ˜Ž

You can use the Outjob files for generating manufacturing files, all of which are included in the JLCPCB folder

# Known Issues
 - QSPI IO2 connected to PE3 not PE2
 - IMU BOOT pin tied low instead of high
 - Payload board I2C pins swapped
 - Umbilical regulator capacitor reversed
 - Umbilical regulator enable pin should be tied to input not output
 - Potential unnecessary use of I2C buses resulting in lack of SWO
 - lack of reverse current protection diode between USB and Vbat
 - lack of hole in the PCB for the GPS antenna
 
# V2 new feature ideas
 - reposition LEDs for better usage of space
 - RPP MOSFET on battery input
